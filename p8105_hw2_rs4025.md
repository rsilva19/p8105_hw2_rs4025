Questions: - best way to print var names? I did names()

## Problem 1

``` r
#read and clean data
data_trash = readxl::read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
                          sheet = 1,
                          range = "A2:N38") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter( dumpster != "NA") %>% 
  mutate( sports_balls = as.integer(
    round(sports_balls)))

data_precip2017 = readxl::read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
                          sheet = 4,
                          range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate( year = 2017)

data_precip2018 = readxl::read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
                          sheet = 3,
                          range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate( year = 2018)
```

``` r
# combine 2017 and 2018 data  (join or bind?)
  
data_precip = 
  bind_rows(data_precip2017, data_precip2018) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate( month = str_to_lower( month.name[month] ))
```

``` r
# total precip in 2018
total_precip = 
  data_precip %>%
  filter( year == 2018) %>% 
  summarize( total = sum(total, na.rm = T))

# median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017
median = 
  data_trash %>% 
  filter( year == 2017) %>% 
  summarize( median = median(sports_balls, na.rm = T))
```

The data set named ‘data\_trash’ gives information about trash disposal
in specified dumpsters. The data set has 32 observations and 14
variables. Some key variables include the dumpster number, the date the
trash is collected, and how much the trash weighs which are named
dumpster, date, and weight\_tons, respectively. Many of the variables
consist of frequent types of trash collected such as plastic\_bottles,
cigarette\_butts and grocery\_bags.

The data set named ‘data\_precip’ gives information about the
precipitation in 2017 and 2018. There are 24 observations and 3
variables, which are month,total and year.

The total precipitation in 2018 is 23.5 inches. The median number of
sports balls in a dumpster is NA since there is no observation of a
dumpster in 2017 in the data set ‘data\_trash’.
